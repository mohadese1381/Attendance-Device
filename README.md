# Attendance Device (C#/.NET Core & Embedded System)

A comprehensive attendance-tracking system developed during an internship in 2023, designed for real-world deployment in educational or organizational settings. This solution combines embedded hardware components with backend services to automate attendance capture and reporting.

## Features
- Integration of an embedded device for real-time attendance capture  
- C#/.NET Core backend for data processing, storage, and analytics  
- SQL Server database for attendance logs and reporting dashboards  
- RESTful API endpoints enabling device communication and mobile/web interface  
- Modular architecture supporting scalability and ease of extension  

## Algorithms & Techniques Used
- Real-time data acquisition from embedded device  
- Database indexing and query optimization for large attendance datasets  
- RESTful service design with authentication & access-control mechanisms  
- Automated reporting of attendance trends and absentee analytics  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Set up the embedded device and connect to backend via REST API.  
3. Configure SQL Server and run database scripts.  
4. Launch the .NET Core backend service and use the attendance interface.
